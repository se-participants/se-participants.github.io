                                    This study seeks to understand the impact of a novel approach (<i>this website</i>) to encourage software professionals to participate in software engineering-related research studies.
                                    SE research seeks to design, study, explore, and improve processes to develop and maintain software applications. However, oftentimes participants in SE research experiments are not
                                    actual software engineers. In this study, participants can provide feedback on a system that acknowledges the effort of professional developers for participating in research studies.<br>

									<h2>Gaps in Software Engineering Education</h2>

                                    This study seeks to learn what gaps exist in software engineering (SE) education. SE education aims to prepare students for careers as 
                                    professional software engineers. However, it is difficult for Computer Science curricula to keep up with the advancements in indsutry. We plan to 
                                    collect data from software professionals on their experiences working with new hires who are recent graduates and to investigate hard and soft skills 
                                    that students may lack when joining the software industry and to motivate the design of future tools and techniques to help teach those skills to students.<br>

                                    <p><strong style="font-weight:900">Type:</strong> Survey (10-15 minutes)</p>
                                    This study seeks to learn about security practices adopted by developers using agile development methodologies. Despite the growing importance of software security,
                                    research suggests developers often fail to adopt security processes in practice, leading to vulnerable software. As software engineering moves from sequential 
                                    processes to iterative software development (i.e. agile), security practices should be more easily incorporated into the development process. However, with agile 
                                    emphasizing person-to-person communication over heavy documentation, the incorporation of traditional security activities into agile processes can be difficult. 
                                    We plan to collect data from software professionals on their experiences working with various security practices to investigate processes and challenges they may 
                                    face when incorporating security into agile software development, to provide implications for increasing the security and robustness of software systems without
                                     negatively impacting development processes and programmers' productivity.<br>
                                    <b>Goal:</b> To understand the experiences, processes, and challenges that software engineers face when adopting security practices during agile software development.
