# SE Participants Templates

Running the [script.py](../script.py) file will automatically generate SE Participant profiles based on the template and styles in the css files above. The script depends on a file named `participants.json` in the top-level directory of this project. The `participants.json` file should be in a similar format as the [`examples.json`](example.json) file that provides the relevant information for the published work and a list of the GitHub usernames for all the participants in the study who consented to joining the system.
